# Why?

Because, in a chaotic world, symmetry means rebellion.  
Because staring into the abyss of a fractal reveals not emptiness, but infinite structure. Because our universe is recursive.

Some say the answers lie within ourselves.  
Others seek truth in science, in philosophy, in faith.  
And then there are those... who look into fractals.  

## What is This?

Welcome to **fract-ol**, a computational project, through which the Mandelbrot and Julia sets unfold themselves. This project serves as a canvas, upon which those two fractals are rendered artistically. 

Fractals are recursive patterns that fold infinitely inward, and yet somehow map the infinite cosmos. A fractal is a mirror reflecting the elegance of chaos theory, the poetry of mathematics, and the algorithmic pulse of the natural order. They are self-similar, recursive patterns encoded deep into the bones of the cosmos and the universe.

The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".  
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, such as a curve or a surface, whose pattern remains consistent at every scale.  

In a world that is random and erratic, fractals are a glimpse of order. Each visualization generated here emerges from the recursive feedback loops of mathematical equations, iterated thousands of times. They converge toward a visual representation of mathematical truths, some of them probably still unknown to humanity.

In this project, mathematics becomes the aesthetic. You are met with fluid visualizations which invite interpretation and contemplation. 

Proceed with an open mind. Do not expect answers, expect echoes and recursion. Expect beauty that breaks logic, and logic that bends the pre-defined norms and preconceptions of beauty. What you are about to explore may change the way you think about order, about chaos, and about the veil between them. 

## ⚙️ How to run it

```bash
make
./fractol mandelbrot
./fractol julia [real_part] [imaginary_part]
```
Experiment with different numbers.

A few notes:

> - `W` and `S` keys will adjust the iteration.
> - Arrow Keys let you drift through the fractal.
> - Mouse Wheel controls zoom—an inward or outward dive.
> - `Backspace` resets the iteration count to 30. `Esc` closes the application.

## 🧩 Patterns

Observe the nuanced shifts. The Julia set responds to modification. It can dance, pulse, and stare back.

What are those two forms (Mandelbrot and Julia) communicating? 

Beyond the patterns are riddles. Why do certain structures recur? Why do some explode, while others stabilize?
